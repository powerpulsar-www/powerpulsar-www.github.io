      <b>PowerPulsar</b> est une application <a href="http://www.be.com">BeOS</a> 
      qui affiche en <b>temps r&eacute;el</b> des <b>effets vid&eacute;o</b> synchronis&eacute;s 
      par la musique.<br>
      <p> Les effets sont programmables via des <b>add-ons</b>. Plusieurs types 
        d'addons existeront mais pour l'instant seuls les filtres sont disponibles. 
        Dans la terminologie PowerPulsar, un <em>filtre</em> est un add-on qui 
        analyse le son entrant et produit des effets vid&eacute;os sympas.<br>
        Pour arriver &agrave; ce r&eacute;sultat, PowerPulsar est capable d'utiliser 
        le son provenant du CD Audio aussi bien que du micro, d'un module ou d'un 
        player de mp3 -- en fait tout ce que sait g&eacute;rer le Media Kit de 
        BeOS. PowerPulsar calcule la FFT (Transform&eacute;e de Fourrier Rapide) 
        du son entrant et appelle les filtres afin qu'ils g&eacute;n&egrave;rent 
        des effets graphiques qui sont ensuite affich&eacute; dans une fen&ecirc;tre 
        de pr&eacute;visualisation ou en plein-&eacute;cran. <br>
        Une interface graphique relativement &eacute;labor&eacute;e permet &agrave; 
        l'utilisateur de param&egrave;trer ses effets. 
      <p> Des exemples de code sont fournis et permettent &agrave; n'importe qui 
        de se programmer son effet favori. Pas besoin de connaissances particuli&egrave;res 
        en C ou C++ pour cela ! 
      <p> PowerPulsar a &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;sent&eacute; officiellement 
        pour la premi&egrave;re fois aux Be Master Awards de la BeDC le 4 et 5 
        Ao&ucirc;t 1997 &agrave; Boston et &agrave; remport&eacute; un prix.

      <b>PowerPulsar</b> is a <a href="http://www.be.com">BeOS</a> application 
      that ouputs <b>real time video effects</b> by monitoring input music. 
      <p> The effects can be freely programed via external <b>add-ons</b>. Several 
        kind of add-ons will exist but currently only filter add-ons are available. 
        A <em>filter</em>, in the PowerPulsar's terminology, is a piece of software 
        that filters the incoming sound input and draws neat video effects on 
        screen.<br>
        To achieve this goal, PowerPulsar let's you use music from the Audio CD, 
        or from any other audio source supported by the BeOS's Media Kit (modules, 
        mp3 players or microphone).<br>
        Basically PowerPulsar computes a couple of FFTs (Fast Fourrier Transform) 
        on the music to get its frequency composition and then call the filter 
        add-ons to build up nice video effects and blit them on a preview window 
        or in fullscreen. <br>
        A sophisticated graphical interface lets the user adapts the effects to 
        its own needs. 
      <p> Some sample code helps you write your favourite effects. No need for 
        extended knowledge in C or C++ for doing this ! 
      <p> PowerPulsar was officially presented for the first time at Be Master 
        Awards, at the Boston BeDC, 4 and 5 August 1997 and won an award.

<p>There are two important points:
<ul>
  <li>Although PowerPulsar is freeware; <a href="#Source">source</a> is not clean 
    enough to be available, even on request.</li>
  <li>You are expected to ask my autorisation before bundling this on any kind 
    of media (CD, etc.)<br>
    Just e-mail me if you are concerned.</li>
</ul>
<center>
  <hr width="50%">
  <br>
</center>
<p> 
<h2><a name="Credits"></a>Credits</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First of all, <b>Powerpulsar</b> is my <b>pet project</b>.<br>
    I've been thinking about video/music synchronization for a long time, and 
    I've been eager to learn about sound processing since my early university 
    years just because of that... Unfortunately I kind of lack the necessary mathematical 
    background to master FFTs and such.</li>
  <li>The application know as Powerpulsar has been mostly <b>shaped visually</b> 
    by <a href="http://www.ouvre.com/experiences/be/">Jean-Marc Ouvr&eacute;</a>.<br>
    His support was tremendous, and his <b>help</b> for the graphics was just 
    awesome.<br>
    Let's face it: the very first prototype of Powerpulsar for BeOS was plain 
    ugly: a very bad effect moving in sync with the music. That would not even 
    qualify as a proof of concept to me right now :-). But when most people where 
    asking me &quot;<i>what's the use, anyway</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>what's your 
    business model</i>&quot; [;-)], JiM saw some <b>potential</b> there (sometimes 
    too much but hey, that's JiM, nobody's gonna stop him :-) !) and we spent 
    many hours sketching <b>UI</b> and user feedback.</li>
  <li>Another person I'd like to thank for his support is <b>SpH</b> and his early 
    enthousiasm.<br>
    Maybe I should also count him as one of the reasons this happened in the first 
    place -- after all he's the one who made me love <b>techno music</b>!</li>
  <li>And finally, a great thank to the various other <b>Powerteam members</b>, 
    namely Xav, Laurent, and Benoit for their help in <b>coding add-ons</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Source"></a>Where is the source?</h2>
<p>Powerpulsar is freeware, but freeware does not mean open-source and there isn't 
  any reason for this to change.<br>
  Let's be obvious: <i>the source code is not available</i>. Non. Niet. Nada.</p>
<p>I've been requested the source many times. I fell for it once but that won't 
  happen again:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>There was once a fellow BeOS lover who managed to convince me to give him 
    a source archive so he could recompile it. I warned him it would be terribly 
    difficult to use, being one of my first &quot;big&quot; project with a design 
    (or lack thereof) which doesn't make it easy to understand the source. The 
    build process is not documented and far from trivial too. And the BeOS R5 
    support is just so-so, especially the lack of add-ons. It ain't pretty and 
    sure ain't easy. But the BeOS lover still wanted it -- he was tech-savvy enough 
    to make something out of it, and sure he would love to toy with that. So I 
    finally agreed on making a nice archive and giving it to him.</p>
  <p>Never heard anything back since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now the answer is an even more firmly no.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h2> <a name="Stop"></a>PowerPulsar for BeOS Stopped - June 2000 </h2>
<p><b>PowerPulsar for BeOS</b> has been officially stopped in <b>June 2000</b>.<br>
  That means the PowerPulsar 0.x and the PowerPulsar 2.x that I started working 
  on. 
<p>The reason is simple: BeOS as a desktop OS is history. The adventure was fun 
  but it ended. Be Inc. switched to BeIA, a good move I believe since it was at 
  least an appealing business plan (understand: one that may generate revenue 
  a some points). Unfortunately, history has we know it decided this would never 
  happen and eventually Be should be acquired by Palm (which didn't officially 
  happen at the time I write this, 10/31/2001).
<p>This is life. 
<p>I think there are two main reasons I stopped PowerPulsar: first I got a life, 
  you know... dating, being outdoors, stuff like that. And second the whole experience 
  was discouraging. PowerPulsar was supposed to be an add-on engine, but I received 
  very little support for add-ons writing (yet I am very thankful for the few 
  who tried at the beginning).
<p>
<p>
<p>Oh yeah I forgot: if you really want to see cool graphic animations on your 
  screen whilst listenning to music, run <a href="http://www.winamp.com">WinAmp</a> 
  and use the two most incredibly add-ons I ever found: WhiteCap and G-Force, 
  by <a href="http://www.55ware.com">55ware</a>. Your mileage may vary.
<p>After thinking about it, the project is not dead, only frozen for an eternity. 
  I believe I'll probably keep the name for one of my other toy ideas: having 
  WhiteCap and G-Force plug'ins run under a console machine, beit the Dreamcast, 
  PS2, X-Box or GameCube (although I don't have any development system for the 
  3 latests... too bad.)<br>

<h2> PowerPulsar 0.8.1 - 11 May 2000 </h2>
<p> More add-ons and a couple of interesting fixes.<br>
  This archive is for BeOS 5 Personal Edition, but it should work also on BeOS 
  R4.5+.<br>
  Please read the text file in the archive for more information. 
<p> <a name="Latest"></a>Here is the archive: 
<p> 
<ul>
  <li> PowerPulsar binary for BeOS 5 PE Intel: PowerPulsar_081_11052000.zip 
    (1.7 MB) 
</ul>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Compiled all addons.
  <li>Made all add-ons sources available for sample code, even if the quality 
    of the source for addons is not always optimal.
  <li>Fixed a bug in the CFilter (was storing a BEntry and 3 BDirectories, thus 
    exhausting the file descriptors). Now using BPath or entry_ref.
  <li>Fixed a bug in the CFilter::loadBitmap in conjunction with MapPlayer, now 
    look for image in local and then only in the img directory
  <li>Fixed the image loader for MapPlayer.
  <li>Fixed a bug in loadConfig, addons were not terminated.
</ul>
<p>There are a few minor bugs to fix later:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MapPlayer may crash if the app is quited too quickly (cf unload)
  <li>4-pixels inversion in the bi-landscape pixel doubler (Big Endian problem)
  <li>missing facet in the scope3d.
  <li>landscape addons and others should not erase background. Use flag instead. 
</ul>

<h2> PowerPulsar 0.8.0 - 03 May 2000 </h2>
<p>

No kidding, I started working again on this project !<br>
This archive is for BeOS 5 Personal Edition, but it should work also on BeOS R4.5+.<br>
Please read the text file in the archive for more information.
<p> Here is the archive: 
<p>
<ul>
<li> PowerPulsar binary for BeOS 5 PE Intel: PowerPulsar_080_04052000.zip (1.3 MB)
</ul>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<ul>
<li> Uses the BeOS 5 PE Media Kit (instead of the old R3-compatible one)
<li> Implements 32 bpp display correctly
<li> Lacks a lot of features and need some UI polishing.
<li> The archive comes with the (kind of obsolete) guided tour. That should do the work to start with.
<li> There is no French material whatsoever. <i>Si vous estimez que je devrais faire un effort pour
traduire l'interface et la documentation (ou son absence), veuillez me le faire savoir</i> <code>:-)</code>
</ul>
 
<hr width="50%">
<h2> PowerPulsar Snapshot 22 March 1999 </h2>
<p>

This is the first <i>crude</i> recompilation on R4 Intel.<br>
Please read all the stuff below before downloading the archive.
<p>
Here are the archives :
<p>
<ul>
<li> PowerPulsar binary for R4 Intel: PowerPulsar_snapshot_03221999.zip (1.01 MB) 
  <li> Sample Add-ons source archive: 1999-03-22.sample_addons_source.zip (192 kB) 
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Download the archive and unzip it somewhere.
<li>Put an audio cd in your computer. You'll get the best idea of the software by choosing
		some kinf of techno music (sorry, no offense for those who do not consider this as
		being music <code>:)</code>). I like to use Trance or Goa for testing. YMMV.
<li>Under R4.0, you <em>MUST</em> open the Audio Preference panel and select 
		"CD" as the input source (in the Input tab of the panel).
<li>Press the "Full Screen" button on the bottom and watch. The CD should start
		playing when the full screen mode enters.
<li>Press either "F" or ESCape or "Q" to exit the full screen mode.
<li>The configuration screen shows an array of applied effects. You can remove one by dragging
		it to the trash (in the bottom of the window). You can add or change one by dragging it
		from the left list and placing it in the array.
<li>I let you figure out the rest of the features.
</ul>

<h3>Known Limitations</h3>
There are quite a lot of them <code>:-)</code> :
<ul>
<li>This is really really a preliminary. It may crash at any moment !
<li>No input selection supported. You <em>MUST</em> open the Audio Preference panel
		and select your input source in the Input tab of the panel. Typically you'll want
		to use the CD player so you need to select "CD" as the source.
<li>Chaning tracks while playing will crash, so do not use the keys 'N' and 'V' while
		playing full screen !
<li>The CD display in the main window, on top, always prints track #00. Anyway the buttons
		can change the track or eject. I don't understand this but, I'm on it.
<li>There are few add-ons. I didn't recompiled them all already.
<li>The rendering mode currently only supports 8-bpp. 32-bpp will come later and the
		16-bpp mode is obsolete, I'll remove it.
</ul>

<p>
I <b>really</b> appreciate to get feedback. I know there are bugs but you can anyway
send me bug reports. I'd like to hear from you. You can mail me or find me on IRC :
<ul>

  <li>e-mail: R'alf
 (please write "PowerPulsar" in the subject so that my Mail-It filters work !) 
  <li>IRC: nick "ralf" (aka ralf_home, ralf_work), channel #amigafr on IRCnet
		or #bedev on EFnet.
</ul>

<p> If you want to create add-ons, please download the addon source archive and 
  have a look at the FFT addon. It's a good point to start with. The thing you 
  want to check is the CFilter.h file that really really is fully commented. I 
  hope you'll find it no too much obscure or obfuscated. Note that you must not 
  try to use anything else that the 8-bpp API. I'll add the support for 32-bpp 
  soon.
